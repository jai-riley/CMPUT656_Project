CoT_prompt = '''

Given a sentence, identify and extract relevant triples of entities connected by a predicate from the provided list.
The format of each triple should be [head, predicate, tail], separated by commas.

Instructions:

Step (1): Entity Extraction
- Extract the entities from the given sentence.
- Group sequences of words that indicate the same role in the sentence as a single entity.
- Exclude adjectives from entities to focus on core nouns.

Step (2): Triple Identification
- Identify a single relevant predicate from the given list that best describes the relationship between the entities. List of predicates: {}.
- Ensure that the order of subject, predicate, and object is maintained based on the predicate's meaning.
- Consider the semantic relationship between entities when selecting a predicate.

Step (3): Triple Formation
- Construct triples in the format [head, predicate, tail].
- Prioritize the triples based on your confidence in their relevance and accuracy.
- Return up to two of the most confident triples. If there is only one confident triple, return that singular triple. Ensure that the predicates in each triple are distinct.


Exmaple 1:
The given sentence is : John Graham , a 55-year-old man from Canada , is accused of shooting Aquash in the head and leaving her to die on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota .

Step (1): Entities: 'Josh Graham', '55', 'Canada', 'Aquah', 'Pine Ridge reservation', 'South Dakota'

Step (2):
'Salmaan Taseer' - 'the' - 'governor'
'President' - - 'Asif Ali Zardari'
'Punjab' - 'where has been held in jail' - 'Bibi'

Match possible predicates on based on the previously given list of predicates:

'Salmaan Taseer' - 'per:title' - 'governor'
'Asif Ali Zardari' - 'per:title' - 'President'
'Bibi' - 'per:stateorprovinces_of_residence' - 'Punjab'
